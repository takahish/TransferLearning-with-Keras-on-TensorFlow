# TransferLearning-with-Keras-on-TensorFlow

## Required libraries

- cv2 3.2.0
- keras 2.0.9
- matplotlib 2.1.0
- numpy 1.12.1
- sklearn 0.19.1
- tqdm 4.11.2
- PIL 4.2.1

## Motivation

I will show how to do transfer learning with Keras on TensorFlow by implementing an image classification application. Transfer Learning is an useful method when you implement Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify some images. By using the method, you donâ€™t only need to reinvent the wheel, but also save your precious time!
